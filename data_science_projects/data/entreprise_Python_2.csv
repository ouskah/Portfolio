Ugz4_fDEN68G7pGjIgl4AaABAg,Jacob P,1 day ago,1527759711188,"Thank you for excellent video tutorial. Question is about last demo (Reinforcement Training) using K-means algorithm. I think I missed something that links the Temp and Pressure data to physical location. I'm assuming from the analysis after the K-means has done its work, you are somehow able to relate each red, green or blue marker shown in their respective cluster, to its original physical location. How would you do this? Many thanks.",0,false,0,,,,,,

But in any case, the most important programming languages for Machine Learning are Java, R language,  C Language and Python.",1

UgzL8lEARCPFJUTDi794AaABAg,Moody,2 months ago,1522575711224,"Hi Guys, great video. I have a question about the sort of data for the linear regression. Why did you have to use size2 as the transpoe of Size. When you use 'regr.fit(size2,house_price), should all data be in this format? Also what should you do about adding multplie data sets? Thank you for your help",0,true,1,,,,,,

2. Yes, while fitting a model the data format for the variables(size2,house_price) should be same
3. pd.merge function is used to combine multiple data sets
Hope that answers your query. Feel free to reach out for any further doubts. 


Happy learning from Simplilearn team!",2
