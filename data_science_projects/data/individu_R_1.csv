In the case of #2 it is possible to have factors levels in one dataset that are not in the other for the same variable. This often times leads to the prediction function throwing errors if it encounters a factor level in the test set that wasn't present in the training set.

Greeting from Indiana.

I was ready to give up, but I heard that you answer questions from your commentaries!

I really liked your video. I was almost done with it, but I am facing a problem with my code.
May I ask your help? I believe that this is a typo problem. Also, you answered somebody about this same issue.

On the part,

ggplot(data.combined[1:891,], aes (x= title, fill = Survived)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) + 
  # wrap a 1d ribbon of panles into 2d 
  facet_wrap(~pclass) + 
  ggtitle(""Pclass"") +
  xlab(""title"") + 
  ylab(""Total Count"") +
  labs(fill = ""Survived"")

I keep getting the error: 
""Error in combine_vars(data, params$plot_env, vars, drop = params$drop) : 
  At least one layer must contain all variables used for facetting""

I also tried to replace ""geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)"" by ""  stat_count(width = 0.5) +"". I got the same error.

On, data.combined I have the fields: Survived (with 0s and 1s) and title filled with data (Mr., Miss., and etc) - please, note the upper case on ""Survived"" and the lower case on ""data""

Finally, my raw data is coming from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

Any ideas of what am I doing wrong?",0,true,2,,,,,,

I always advise folks to get the .R and .CSV files from the GitHub as I try to keep the code up to date (e.g., I made some updates today). Also, folks often can troubleshoot any problems by looking at the GitHub code. In looking at your problem it appears that you are using the wrong variable name in your call to facet_wrap(). Since you are using the newer .CSV files from Kaggle the code should be facet_wrap(~ Pclass).

I could have also removed the label column from the training data and stored it in a separate variable to achieve the same goal (i.e., same number of variables across test and train). By default (i.e., R S3 and S4 objects) R uses immutable data structures. While I have not timed to be certain, my intuition is that the running time would be the same as new objects are created in both cases.

I would offer, however, that stacked bar plots work very well under the circumstances intended - to quickly visually show that you have clean separation of classes. Specifically, the best features will be overwhelmingly one class in a binary classification scenario. This is easily detected using visualizations.

I have used both Python and R in my Data Science work (Python is my go-to for Text Analytics/NLP), but I prefer R. In fact, R has supplanted C++ as my all-time favorite language. That being said, the learning curve for R is non-trivial. It is very much akin to C++ in that it requires study to master. However, I find that I am wildly productive using the language - even compared to using Python with Pandas. If you're not familiar, Pandas is the de facto standard library to make Python look like R in terms of data wrangling capabilities.


To be honest, you can't go wrong focusing on either language - pick the one that is likely to keep you motivated with your Data Science journey. If you find R frustrating, focus on Python. While I would argue that Python's data visualization capabilities continue to lag behind R, Python is catching up in many Data Science capabilities, and leads R in terms of Neural Network/Deep Learning options.

Either
1. add the following during import to the end of the read.csv command:

It's is probably because you have to put the columns of both sets in the same order and the added variable Survived should start with a capital letter. 

I'm a newby but figured it out by looking at the datasets..

So the creation of the data.frame test.survived should be:
test.survived <- data.frame(Survived = rep(""None"", nrow(test)), test[,])

Next the added variable Survived in the test.survived data.frame has to be the 2nd column. You can reorder by issuing this command:

I then pasted the following code from your original paste at the end of the Video 1 script and attempted to run it. This was the output:

This error indicates that your CSV file isn't the same as the CSVs in the GitHub. I corrected the code with the following output:

Error: StatBin requires a continuous x variable the x variable is discrete. Perhaps you want stat=""count""?



This error indicates that your code isn't the same as the GitHub. Here's the output from the source code from the GitHub that works. Note that it uses stat_count() instead of geom_histogram():

However, there are many missing value for age - so many that you can't throw observations out with missing ages (e.g., your training set would be too small - not to mention there are missing ages in the test set!). One option is to attempt to impute the missing ages from the rest of the data (e.g., replace missing ages for adult males in 3rd class with the median value of ages for all males in 3rd class), however the strategy I like to employ first (your mileage may vary) is to see if I can engineer proxy features from the data. As the video illustrates, every observation has a title and title appears to be a good proxy for both sex and age.

This outcome is often called the label. This allows you to provide data to a machine learning algorithm where the algorithm uses the label as the basis for detecting any patterns in the data (e.g., the data seems to follow the pattern of ""women and children first"" for survival). This is commonly referred to as ""training the model"". The test data is a set of data you do not train with. This data becomes the ""unseen"" data that you present to your trained model to find out how accurate it actually is (e.g., does the pattern of ""women and children first"" really hold across data that you didn't train with). In the case of Kaggle competitions I tend to follow this high level process: 1) Analyze the data. 2) Pick training features that look predictive. 3) Perform exploratory modeling. 4) Perform feature engineering. 5) Repeat steps 1-4 for a few iterations. 6) Build model for submissions. 7) Create predictions for test set. 8) Submit predictions to Kaggle for scoring. 9) Analyze submission results. 10) Repeat steps 1-10 until I can't improve any more, the competition ends, or I get bored.  :-)

The train data.frame now has columns:

So after creating the test.survived data.frame you might want to swap the first two columns for consistency:

test.survived <- data.frame(Survived = rep(""None"", nrow(test)), test[,])

# Swap first two columns to match ordering in 'train' dataframe

You're not very clear in what you are asking for.
Can you tell me at what point in David's video you are having trouble?
If you have RStudio, check the variables in your session. They are listed in the top-right window in RStudio.
The changes to the data are small. Instead of, for example, ""pclass"", they begin with a capital like ""Pclass"".
Go through all of your code and make sure you are using consistent names for your variables. R is case-sensitive which means: 'a' is not 'A', 'b' is not 'B', ... 'survived' is not 'Survived', and so on.
It may be easier to follow the video by changing all column names and variables to match those used by David in the video.
Once you have confirmed that your data and code names all match, look carefully at where your code is failing.
If you give me a time in the video I may be able to take a look in my free time.

This is because the column names on the tables are case sensitive, at least for some functions or versions of R / RStudio. It seems like there are some capitalisation mismatches in the source code and datasets provided.

(Specifically in the version I have the column names in the datasets have leading capitals, while all references in the code are all lower case. Going through the code and changing all references to be capitalised fixed the issue for me.)

Ensure that the case you use when refering to columns in code is the same as the column headings in the data. Also occurs when using rbind if the cases are different between the two datasets you're binding, or if they are different in any other way including additional or missing columns.

Does the updated version of the cvs having one extra column in the left most position have anything to do with the error?",0,false,0,,,,,,

I guess the data frame column names are case sensitive; ""survived"" is not the same as ""Survived"".  Good to know.  Your suggestion handled the error.  It looks like the Titanic data sets on Kaggle have been updated since this tutorial, as the column names are slightly different.",1

Hello David,
I am learning Data Science Topics now while following your videos.  Videos are helping a lot.  
I just started working on code with Rstudio.   I installed R and Rstudio.  I copied the code that you have mentioned in this video and followed the steps.  But getting > setwd(""C:/kaggle/Titanic"")
> train -> read.csv('train.csv', header = TRUE)
Error: object 'train' not found
> test -> read.csv('test.csv', header = TRUE)
Error: object 'test' not found


after setting the working directory and run the code.


Can you pls let me know what I am missing here?


Thanks.",0

Hi David, I tried ?data.frame and enter.
But did not see help loaded in the right frame.  Looks like there is something in my Rstudio.  I am using Windows 8 64bit Machine.  Can you pls help?

Personally I found R as a programming language relatively easy to learn to be productive (e.g., using for loops). However, there is a learning curve to get proficient with the ""True R Way"" of doing things - something I am learning as I go along.",0
