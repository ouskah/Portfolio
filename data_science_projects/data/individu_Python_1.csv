Ugzw90v-85066wdX7VZ4AaABAg,ManuAlvarado22,1 day ago,1527758163013,"I barely understand what i am doing, but i tried SVC and GaussianNB apart from the decision tree, and the GaussianNB model is definitely the one that conviced me the most.

For example, it says that someone is a man (in my case an alien) even though in the dataset its label was female (human in my case). And i think this is pretty cool.

But, one thing that calls my attention is that shoe size seems to be pretty determinant here, and i do not quite like it. I guess it is because of the x's data.

Really cool. Thank you so much for this video!",0,false,0,,,,,,

UgydTJN67BNd5AayI994AaABAg,Elektra Kypridemou,4 months ago,1517476574913,"For any of you experiencing problems with scikit-learn package (see Mick's comment):

The reason is that scikit-learn requires some other packages to be pre-installed. Namely, the requirements for scikit-learn version 0.19.1 are the following: 
* Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.3), 
* NumPy (>= 1.8.2), 
* SciPy (>= 0.13.3). 

To fix this issue try to use 
          pip install -U scikit-learn[alldeps] 
instead of 
         pip install -U scikit-learn 
This way you install all the prerequisites along with the scikit-learn package, so you overcome any issues coming from missing packages [if any]. 

Regarding Mick's solution:
Anaconda also fixes the problem because it comes with some pre-installed packages, including the ones needed by scikit-learn. However, when the required packages are installed, Anaconda itself is not necessary to fix the issue. You can check the Anaconda package lists here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs",0,true,1,,,,,,

If I did the first portion correctly (from from sklearn to print(prediction), my Anaconda version of Python printed the output of  ['female']. 

I only checked this video out because a new friend in coding recommended I check you out, and I will definitely check out more videos soon. Even though in SOME ways it's too advanced for me, I have definitely been told and now more often to not get caught up in the boring syntax that you should learn in the beginning. Sometimes it's fun to just skip right to a mission like this, to keep yourself entertained, before returning to the foundations and continuing building a solid structure.

Probably not the best advice, but my current research (what are the benefits of sys and argv?) made me pass out earlier lol. Found this video before I found those answers, so g2g before I can return to my Learn Python the Hard Way exercises!

Then instead of using a command prompt look if you can find an ""anaconda prompt"". open it, it looks very similar to a regular command prompt. then instead of pip install xyz do conda install xyz if you need to. but it looks like anaconda has most of the stuff needed for this tutorial installed already.

So I installed numpy by using a wheel file. It told me I already had a version of numpy 1.9.1 which it tried to unistall I think but it apparently failed.

- First make sure you only have 1 python instance running (i recommend py 3.6) so uninstall 2.5. 

-Now download these wheel files numpy+mkl and scipy. you can find them both in 

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy  

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy

make sure to download the version according to your system x32 or x64. 

-After download, open CMD or command prompt, set the route to the folder or the location of the 2 files (they can be in the desktop) and last, install first, numpy as follows: 

pip install ""and the whole name of the file, including the .whl extension"" 

should look something like this: 

pip install numpy-1.13.0+mkl-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl (this should also delete some older instance of numpy if installed) 

now proceed to install scipy the same way you did with numpy, 
pip install ""scipy-0.19.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl"" (or the name of the version you downloaded)

and thats it

For the last thing, people will eventually need to learn the ""boring stuff"", and if they've started with all that, they're gonna have a harder time going back to basics. I know it's hard to see things from the perspective of a complete beginner, but you have to understand that ""complete begginer"" means that they don't know extremely basic things like what a for loop is. Would you still rather they go that route and learn just from your videos?

There's a reason programming resources are a thing, if you could start with a hands-on project and get the same amount of value, everyone would be doing that. I'm all about doing fun stuff, but when we're talking extreme basics like what I mentioned, I do think that learning the fundamentals before you jump in is the way to go (actually learning them, not listening to a few sentences that kind of explain them).",0

Machine Learning is just a tool to help you do that. In addition, in ML, you don't have any assumptions to begin with. If you do have domain knowledge of the problem, it's better to use that instead of throwing in all the data into an ML algorithm in the beginning.

 * Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.3),
 * NumPy (>= 1.8.2),
 * SciPy (>= 0.13.3).

To fix this issue try to use
        pip install -U scikit-learn[alldeps]
instead of 
       pip install -U scikit-learn

This way you install all the prerequisites along with the scikit-learn package, so you overcome any issues coming from missing packages [if any].

Anaconda also fixes the problem because it comes with some pre-installed packages, including the ones needed by scikit-learn. However, when the required packages are installed, Anaconda itself is not necessary to fix the issue.

UghGiizHJWZXIngCoAEC,Icarus,1 year ago,1496308636259,"A quick question for Siraj. Using ML a computer can learn the pattern in its input data set, but can ML help a computer to think/understand said input data set. If not, then what can?",0,true,3,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,UghGiizHJWZXIngCoAEC.8Jkq9uJDKyy8Jl1BTx_UOv,13thxenos,1 year ago,1496308636933,"Well, I'm not Siraj, but I want to say what I think nonetheless. What you think about ""thinking"" or ""understanding"" are not well-defined objects without any ambiguity. On some level, you can think of understanding as to finding a pattern from the data at hand to the previous data acquired before. That is what we humans do. You don't actually understand ""Red"" as a color. You perceive something and you remember that you assigned the word of ""Red"" to that perception before. This example was from a low-level perception, but the same reasoning can be done for abstract concepts too. 
So in a sense, ML can make a computer understand. And the only thing that stands in its way is the lack of power to make a deep enough network to learn more abstract concepts. 
In fact, the neural network and deep learning mimic human understanding so much that they are being studied by cognitive scientist so that they understand the human brain better.",3
,,,,,,,,UghGiizHJWZXIngCoAEC.8Jkq9uJDKyy8JmHNPs5g5z,B Skit,1 year ago,1496308636941,"What beginners usually take as ""to think/understand"" is ""tuning on human intelligence"". ML is a way of mimicking reasoning on a level; we try different formulas and persons like Siraj advertise about the best results and explain how the theoretical model can be implemented(thanks a lot for that!)

What you want is a system that can mimic us. It's harder because our environment and randomness shaped us. Here, we are starting to explore models for that but we are still slow at producing new models (no efficient technic is known yet).

Unfortunately, we don't even know enough on the brain to be able to start enouncing what an intelligence ""human-like"" might be. This approach is doomed due to the unability to produce the needed data for a model to exist.

BUT, you can choose a specific task (like we usually do in this domain) or a specific approach (like Google DeepMind do, for instance; using only game score to autonomously learn how to solve the game) and, from your specifications, you choose a goal and different metrics to judge the reaching of the goal.

Then you can apply different models: from pre-treatment of the data to machine learning or other method and, eventually, post-treatment.
You apply your statistics and select the best model to do the task. You focus on this one and search for different technics to improve your algorithm over this goal.

And then... well I guess, if you can break your idea of ""thinking/understanding"" to more elaborate pieces trainable and measurable, you can effectively reach something :)",0
